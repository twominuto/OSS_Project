# OSS_Project

This is github of Our team's **JSON Parser** Project

We applied the JSON Parser to create the board game recommendation program that recommends the board game to the player with some player's data.

This project could be utilized in a board game rental business. Since it recommends the list of board games to the player, the player could select the board game that perfectly meets his or her condition.

To get started, 
1. compile temp.c
2. ./a.out a.json
3. select from the options, and press enter.
4. press 3 and enter to exit.

For any further assistance, leave note.
